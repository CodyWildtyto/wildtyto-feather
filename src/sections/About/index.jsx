          Since the first time I created my own website when I was 10 years old.
          I took a fancy to do creation of all about digital content. Such as
          animation, game and tool software. It defined my choice of my career
          in the future. Most of time, I was able to learn new skills of
          programming by my self. However, I was concerned about the design and
          the thinking of the users. The point was the key I decided to major in
          media design. Because of that, I am good at both of development and
          user experience.

          Recently, my colleague and I designed a service in a hackathon. After
          that, we rebuilt the idea to a new chat bot -- noper. It helped people
          who usually have business conversation at messaging tools when they
          were working. To manage and notify progress of the tasks with team
          members. We released the service for public for few monthes. Although
          there were many users registered our service, it was hard to be main
          income for us. Unfortunately, we decided to close the project.
